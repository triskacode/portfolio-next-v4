Hello! My name is **Triska Mahfud K**, a Fullstack Developer with a primary focus on **backend architecture**. I am also experienced in **frontend development** using Next.js. With expertise in Node.js, Golang, and frameworks such as Express.js, Nest.js, and Fiber, I design scalable and efficient backend systems. On the frontend side, I build dynamic and responsive interfaces. I am passionate about learning new technologies to create effective and sustainable solutions.

In terms of my **values or work philosophy**, I strive to develop solutions that are not only effective but also efficient, maintaining high **code quality** standards. I believe that good **collaboration** among team members is key to achieving the best results, and I am always open to sharing knowledge and learning from others. I am committed to **continuous learning** to stay relevant and tackle challenges in the fast-evolving tech industry. When building backend architecture, I ensure that the systems I create are capable of **adapting and growing** with increasing user needs.

Looking ahead, my focus is to continue developing my skills in **backend architecture**, aiming to create scalable, reliable, and high-performance systems. I am interested in contributing to **open-source projects** to expand my professional network and give back to the global developer community.
